# Image_Classification

## Project 1
### Dataset
The datasets ("train.h5" and "test.h5") contains:

- a training set of 209 train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)

- a test set of 50 test images labeled as cat or non-cat

- each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3)/(64,64,3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).

### Objective

We will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify images as cat or non-cat.We build separate functions that are required to build a neural net structure and merge them finally to classify the images depending on whether it is a cat picture or non cat picture.
