# Image_Classification
The image classification algorithms are built through inspirations from Andrew Ng's course Neural Networks and Deep Learning in Coursera.The datasets and the approach followed are based upon the assignments and coursework.

## Project 1
### Dataset
The datasets ("train.h5" and "test.h5") contains:

- a training set of 209 train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)

- a test set of 50 test images labeled as cat or non-cat

- each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3)/(64,64,3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).

### Objective

We will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify images as cat or non-cat.We build separate functions that are required to build a neural net structure and merge them finally to classify the images depending on whether it is a cat picture or non cat picture.

## Project 2

### Objective

- We will build a Planar data classification model with one hidden layer.The code is built to use  any 2-class dataset loaded from plot_function.py.
- We use noisy_moons data set in this notebook.You can further experiment with differnt data sets found in the notebook.
- The code for building data set is in the plot_function.py, which can be found in the custom_plotting_fns folder in the repository.

## Project 3
### Objective

We will build an image-classification algorithm using the methodology for building Deep Neural Nets that can correctly classify images as cat or non-cat.We build separate functions that are required to build astructure and merge them finally to classify the images depending on whether it is a cat picture or non cat picture.

- We will implement a 2-layer neural network
- We will build a L -layer neural net for image classification.
